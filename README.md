trading strategy doesnt work for now   :(   
however the ml models and etl work perfectly   :)
trading_app.py is the streamlit
newetl.py and ML_MODEL_ATTEMPT.py (XGboost) are not polished and have been changed abit to make it work with the trading app
newetl.py and ML_MODEL_ATTEMPT.py are based off of ML_MODEL_ATTEMPT.ipynb and newetl.ipynb
ML_MODEL_ATTEMPT.ipynb and newetl.ipynb are complete in my opinion but 
i need to check that the api wrapper is correct 100% which is the apiwrapper2 file
